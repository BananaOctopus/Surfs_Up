# Surfs_Up

## Analysis

### Overview of the analysis:
We chose June and December as example months for the overall weather(temperature and percipitation) of Oahu, Hawaii to determine if it would be a good place to place a surf and icecream shop! Decent, as in warm weather and few rainy days was ideal to determine if this would be a prime place to set up this kind of shop, since you want it to be warm so people get icecream and you do not want many rainy days, since that is not great for surfing.

### Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

Considering June:
- Looking at Fig 1. the average tempurature in June is 74.9 degrees Fm and an average precipitation of 0.14 inches
- Considering in Fig 1, that within the 75th percentil, the precipitation rate is still below average, seems to mean it does not rain often, or have big downpours often in June

Considering December:
- December precipitation overall is even lower than June, 
- Also a bit cooler than June but only by a few degrees (Fig. 2) But still much warmer than the rest of the US with a min of 56 degrees F, and a max of 83 degrees F.

### Summary: 

In summary, given the general warm temperature and overall lack of rain, or at least heavy downpours often, it would be a great place to open a shop for both icecream and surfing.

**As an additional analysis for December, I thought it would be fun to look at the overall weather for Christmas Day over the years:**

Overall, since Hawaii is on the equater, you would not have a white Christmas, with a minimum tempature of only 60 degrees F. and seems to be unlikely to rain!
